8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
Well, as week 4 CSE341 got 80% of my time and attention the scales flopped the other way and the 
piper was paid. My other course, i will not name, is a bad joke. It is requiring 20-30 hours a week 
with multiple team meetings. I dont want to make excuses but its hurting the rest of my studies.
I am asking for forgiveness on the latness of this turn in. I am doing all I can.
