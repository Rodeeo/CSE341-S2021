I appreciate you letting me get this back to you a second time. If you look I submiited the last one at 11:59pm.
I had thought I already turned it in but I guess i didn't. I was SUPER scrambling to grab the week 3 and turn it in.
Sorry.

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
I was able to add my own iventory.json and have the app search and pull product images and from it.
This week wasnt too bad, But I feel like I'm going to pay for it in week 4. Calm before the storm.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
None, I was able to meet all rubric requirements.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
After dealing with a clunky PHP database if feels night to be able to deal with a simple sql that I have control over. 

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I dont have any recommendations for this week. 

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   4 - Meets requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I was able to commit the time to make sure I covered every base in the rubric.
Sadly, I did not have more time to go above and beyond the mark.
